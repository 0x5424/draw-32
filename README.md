# `draw-32`

This markdown file will contain instructions for setting up the `draw-32` instruction builder SPA.
For design philosophy & a further technical breakdown, see the adjacent [`ABSTRACT.md`](./ABSTRACT.md)

The SPA itself is written with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).

## Dependencies

The project is written in TypeScript. It is installed via the `npm` package manager, which is reliant on `node` being available on the host machine.

## Setup
After installing the appropriate node.js version, the remaining dependencies will be made available after running `npm install`.
Then, the webapp can be started in development mode with `npm run dev`.

## Usage

(ongoing)
