# `draw32`

This markdown file will contain instructions for setting up the `draw32` instruction builder SPA.
For design philosophy & a further technical breakdown, see the adjacent [`ABSTRACT.md`](./ABSTRACT.md)

The SPA itself uses the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs) framework. Please refer to their documentation for more info on the project structure.

## Dependencies

The project is written in TypeScript. It is installed via the `npm` package manager, which is reliant on `node` being available on the host machine.

## Setup
After installing the appropriate node.js version, the remaining dependencies will be made available after running `npm install` from the project root.

The app can then run locally with `npm run dev`[^1].

[^1]: MacOS users may need to [specify a different port](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/issues/124) when running the app.
